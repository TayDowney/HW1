# HW1
I did this four times now. Will it work?

I finally got my scanner to work.

I would like to stay behind and figure out what I was doing wrong so that this does not happen again please. I do wish that I can get some form of completion credit but if not then I understand the reasoning and will ensure that I do this assingment ALWAYS 4 days in advance if my schedule allows.
